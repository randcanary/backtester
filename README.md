# Backtester

A simple backtesting engine built in Python to simulate buying and selling stocks based on historical data. The engine allows you to test trading strategies by simulating portfolio management, tracking trades, and evaluating stop-loss and take-profit conditions. The backtester is designed to be easily extendable and allows for custom strategies to be tested against historical market data.
